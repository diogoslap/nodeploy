# Nodeploy
Deploy continuous integration with GITLAB

This project is using the node version 0.12.7 because some modules is still unstable in version 4.1.

I'll update as possible

#Prerequisites
* Nodejs 0.12.x
* MongoDB
* GitLab server


# Installing

>  npm install


After that, config your project with your Git LAb and your Database in the file config.js.

The port default for database is still 27017, I'll change it as soon.

If everything is installed, start the project

> npm start

To test your connection to get your owned projects, put in browser:

http://localhost:5000/projects/map/owned

Questions?

Have a nice day
